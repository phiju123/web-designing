<p><ul><li>The undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at S V National Institute of Technology,
 has been offered since 1988-89, with the first batch of Bachelors of Computer Engineering graduating
 in 1992 (intake 30) under the patronage of the erstwhile Department of Electronics Engineering.
 The Department of Computer Engineering was bifurcated from the Department of Electronics Engineering
 in 2002. With a focus on balancing high-quality research to substantiate the class-room teaching the
 Ph D program has been started in the year 2005 and the inception of the M Tech course was taken place
 in 2006. The department has also started the PG progamme, M.Tech. (by Research) in the year 2007.
 Currently, it offers the UG, PG and PhD degrees in Computer Engineering.
 </li>
<br>
 <li>The total intake in the department at the UG level is 93 students whereas at the PG level is 25. 
 There are in all 30 PhD scholars registered currently in the department with 04 as full-time,  
 01 scholar as part-time project fellow, 16 as part-time external, 06 as part-time (internal faculty 
 members), and 03 as part-time (Lecturers on-contract basis). <br>
 </li><br>
 <li>The Computer Engineering Department has sanctioned faculty strength of 2 Professors, 3 Associate 
 Professors, 6 Assistant Professors and 3 Lecturers on Contract. However, the deficit in the human 
 resources is attempted to be made up by hiring teaching assistants.
 </li><br>
 <li>The department has well-equipped laboratories consisting of the state-of-the-art servers, 
 computers, microprocessor kits, embedded evaluation boards, network simulator kits, and different 
 simulation software packages. The hardware in the laboratories consists of 18 nos of IBM/HCL servers, 
 182 nos of desktop PCs, 01 GPU workstation and sufficient numbers of other peripherals including 
 printers. The department also has Wireless Sensor Network kits consisting of a variety of sensor 
 motes viz. Mica2, Iris and Lotus motes with a range of different sensors and classroom kits.
 </li><br>
 <li>The curriculum has been designed keeping in view industrial and research needs, as well as 
 the rapid development in the IT industry. Induction of new courses from time to time enables 
 the students to keep abreast of recent technological development. Flexibility in curriculum 
 is provided through Electives, Seminars and Projects.
 </li><br>
 <li>The students with their innovative ideas implemented, routinely present Technical Papers at 
 National level Symposiums, and achieve laurels. The Department has always strived for excellence 
 and receives grants to develop and modernize its laboratories. A dedicated laboratory funded by 
 MHRD under the National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) has also been established 
 for the purpose of E-learning through online Web and Video courses in Engineering.
